This is a minimum demo of file upload in Play framework with simple word count
=====================================

Simply startup the application with Play 2.2.1
And hit the browser with "localhost:9000" for demo
A simple file upload form is presented and select a text file to upload.
The result is in JSON format:
{
    filename: [Filename that user upload],
    wordcount: [Number of words in the file],
    countMap: {
        [mapping for word occurance]   
    }
}
    

TODO:
Logging - No logging was done
Filetype validation - now is "assuming" user upload a valid text file
More text case - that's always better
